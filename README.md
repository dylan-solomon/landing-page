The Odin Project's CSS Foundations Project #1
The goal of this project is to display my understanding of CSS and Flexbox.

Here is the design we are attempting to create using HTML and CSS: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png

Colors and Fonts: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png

By the end of this project I will have shown that I can position elements using flexbox, and can design a basic website from scratch
